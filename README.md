# Air Pollution Forecasting using ARIMA in Python

## Introduction

This repository provides a Python implementation of time-series forecasting using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for air pollution data collected in the city of Beijing. The dataset, donated on 3/22/2016, consists of hourly responses from a gas multisensor device deployed in an Italian city. The hourly responses include averages recorded from 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The goal is to predict the concentrations of various gases, including CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).
